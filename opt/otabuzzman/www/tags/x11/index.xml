      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently told me about porting a VNC server to a microcontroller. We joked about it and I capped it off by saying I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about porting X11 to iOS. I ended up using VNC instead, but my buddy said there would probably already be an X11 port for iOS - and he was right. Mocha X11 is an X server implementation for tablets. It is available in the App and Play Stores. There are lite versions with a session interval of five minutes. Too short for serious work, but enough to get a taste of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to see decades-old software meet modern devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
